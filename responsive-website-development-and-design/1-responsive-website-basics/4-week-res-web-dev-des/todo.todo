Make a responsive, interactive web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Create a web page about yourself or a subject you are interested in, using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Your submission should consist of 3 files:

 ✔ A HTML document @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ A CSS document @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ A JavaScript document  @done (16-04-13 15:33)

 ✔ You can also upload additional files such as jQuery or Bootstrap if needed.  @done (16-04-13 15:33)

The web page should have the following features:

 ✔ It should display correctly if the person viewing it has placed all the files you have supplied in a folder on their machine @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ It should use at least one of each of HTML img, h1 and div tags (and more if needed) @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ It should use CSS to set the style of the text and other parts of the design as appropriate, in at least 3 ways. @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ It should be responsive - it should change the layout if the screen size changes @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ The user should be able to change the page in some way by interacting with a GUI element such as a button.  @done (16-04-13 15:33)
 ✔ Write some text on the page explaining how the user can interact. You should implement this feature using JavaScript.  @done (16-04-13 15:33)
